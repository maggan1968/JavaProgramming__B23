OOP: design pattern of the applications in organized and modular way

	Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism

	Encapsulation (POJO): hiding the data by using private.
						  generate public getter/setter instance methods

						 getter (read ONLY)

						 setter (write ONLY)

						 IF PRIVATE DATA IS FINAL, WE CAN NOT GENERATE SETTER


 	Inheritance (TestBase) : building parent & child relationships between classes

 						child class: inherits all the variables & methods from parent class

 						parent class: does not inherit anything from child

 				advantages:
 					easy to maintain
 					improves the reusability
 					less codes
 					less memory





 		abstract TestBase
 				driver
			setUp (@BeforeEach):
				setup driver
				open the browser
				implicitwait
				maximize browser
				LogIn

			tearDown (@AfterEach):
				quit



		TestClass1 extends TestBase

			@Test (verify the title)


		TestClass2 extends TestBase

		TestClass3 extends TestBase
