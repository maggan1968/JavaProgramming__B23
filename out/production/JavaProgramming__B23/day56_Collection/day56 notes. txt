Topic: Collection Continue

Package name: day56_Collection


Collection framework: consists of multiple interfaces, each interface is implembnted by classes

	Collection (I): Dynamic Sized
					supports non-primitives ONLY

			extended by List, Set, Queue


			List (I): has index numbers, accept duplicates

				ArrayList (C): Array Based Class, internally uses array
								retrieving the data is faster ( get() )

				LinkedList (C): each objects are doublly linked
								adding & removing are faster (add() & remove())

				Vector (C): is synchronized ==> thread-safe


				Stack (C): is synchronized ==> thread-safe. LIFO (last in first out)

					pop(): removes the last inserted object from the stack



			Set (I): does not have index, does not accept duplicates

				HashSet (C): order is random. accepts null key. faster

				LinkedHashSet (C): keeps the insertion order as it is. accepts null key

				TreeSet (C): keeps the sorted order. does not accept null key (nullPointerException will be given)



			Queue (I): does not have index, accept duplicates. FIFO (first in first out)

				poll(): removes the first object from the queue, and returns it. FIFO

				PriorityQueue (C): order is random. does not have index number

				ArrayDequeue (C): keeps the same insertion order. does not have index number

				LinkedList (C): keeps the same insertion order, has index number



synchronized: used for achieving thread safety

			advantage: thread-safe
			disadvantage: slow

			one thread at a time


Thread: subset of a process. A sequence of execution within a process

		shares all the resources of process


Process: execution instance of a program
		ex: chrome, firefox, sublime, intelliJ...


multi-thread: two or more threads are being executedwithin the process

multi-tasking: running multiple programs concurrently

concurrently vs paralely:

		concurrently: 900 * 5 = 4500 seconds
			chrome browser (process)
				tab1: etsy.com (300 test cases)
				tab2: amazon.com (300 test cases)
				tab3: ebay.com (300 test cases)

				long time


		Paralely: 300 * 5 = 1500 seconds
			chrome Browser (process1)
				etsy.com (300 test cases)

			firefox browser (process2)
				amazon.com (300 test cases)

			safari browser (process3)
				ebay.com (300 test cases)




Iterable: Root Interface of Collection
		Classes that are implementing iterable interface gains the ability to use iterator interface

		Iterator (I):
			1. allows us to get access to each object

			2. allows us to remove any objects from collection type


			methods:
				hasNext(): checks if there is object. returns boolean

				next():
						if hasNext() is true ==> can get access to the object
						if hasNext() is false==> no object can be accessed


				remove()

Task:
	Given:
		List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
        names.addAll(Arrays.asList(
            "Ahmed", "ahmed", "aHmEd", "John", "Ercon", "Daniel", "Mustafa", "Mohammed"
        ));

        remove all the names "ahmed" without using removeIf
