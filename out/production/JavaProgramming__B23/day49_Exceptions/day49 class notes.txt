	5. throw keyword
	6. custom exception 



Exception: unexpected or unwanted events

		unchecked exception (unexpected event): occures during the runtime

					RuntimeException class is the parent of all the unchecked exception

					All the runtime exceptions are unchecked exception


		checked exception (unwanted event): occures during the compile time

					All the exceptions that are not runtime execptions are checked exception


Exception Handlings:
		
		1. try & catch blocks: used for handling both chekced and unchecked exceptions

				try{
					exception code	
				}catch(ExceptionClass e){
					statements
				}

				multi-catch block: parent exception type CAN NOT be placed before child exception type


				finally block: always gets executed regardless of the exception


		2. throws keyword: used for handling checked exceptions ONLY


						caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception



throw keyword: manually throw an exception
		
		throw ObjectOfException
