package name: day36_ArrayList

Warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can set the last element of the Integer arraylist to zero 
	            ex:
	                list = [1,2,3,4,5];
	                output: [1,2,3,4,0];

	2. write a program that can multiply each odd number by 2
	            ex: list = [1,2,3,4,5];
	                output: [2,2,6,4,10]

	3. write a program that can combine two String arrays into one arrayList
	            ex: 
	                arr1 = {"A", "B", "C"};
	                arr2 = {"D", "E", "F", "G"};
	                list ==> {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"}


ArrayList Method:
	remove(): when we remove one element. DO NOT USE IT INSIDE THE LOOP
	removeAll(): when we want to remove multiple elements (if the elements we want to remove are known)
	retainAll(): when we want to retain multiple elements (if the elements we want to remove are known)
	removeIf(Predicate): when we want to remove the elements under a condition (if the elements we want to remove are unknown)


		Predicate<Integer>  name =   p ->  boolean
										    p < 5

lambda:
	 		 -> expression


Array Utility class: Arrays. designed for Array data structures ONLY
		
		toString, equals, sort, asList, deepToString...


Collection Utility Class: Collections, designed for collection data structures ONLY


	import java.util. Collections;

	Methods:
		Collections.sort(CollectionType)

		Collections.reverse(CollectionType)

		Collections.swap(CollectionType, index1, index2)

		Collections.replaceAll(CollectionType, old value, new values)

		Collections.frequency(CollectionType, element): returns the frequency of the elements, as int

		Collections.max()

		Collections.min()
