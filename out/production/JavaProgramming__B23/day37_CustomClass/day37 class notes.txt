package name: day37_CustomClass

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can swap the first and last elements of an ArrayList

	2. write a program that can return the first unique elements of an ArrayList

	3. write a program that can find the frequency of character from a String
                DO NOT use nested loop

                "AABBCCDDEE"  ==> "ABCDE"
                output: A2B2C2D2E2

	4. Write a program that can return the nth largest number from an ArrayList of integers


custom class:


	String class:
		Attributes:
			text, index

		Actions:
			substring(), charAt() ....

		str1 = "Cybertek";
		str2 = "Java";
		..

	Car class:
		Attributes:
			model, make, year, price, color

		Actions:
			drive(), break()...


object: came from class, instance of a class

	car1: Toyota
	car2: BMW
	car3: Tesla
	...


instance: each object has its own copy

instance variables: object variables
				each object has its own copy of instance variables


instance methods: object methods
			does not have static keyword



Tasks:
	Cat:
		Attribute: name, color, gender, age, breed....
		Actions: scratch(), breakThings(), jump(), eat(), drink(), meow()....
				 setInfo(), getInfo()


 	Car:
 		Attributes: Make, Model, Color, Price, Year
 		Actions: driver()...
 				 setInfo()
 				 getInfo(): 

	Student:
		Attributes: name, gender, age, studentID
		Actions: eat(), sleep(), drink(), coding()...
				setInfo(): to set the attributes
				getInfo(): print the attributes


Task:
	create a custom class named Rectangle
	    Attributes:
	        length, width

	    Actions:
	        setInfo: sets the length and width of the rectangle
	        calculateArea(): calculates the area of the rectangle, returns it as double
	        calculatePerimeter() calculates the perimeter of the rectangle, returns it as double
	        getInfo(): prints the width, length, area and perimeter of the rectangle



2. create 10 objects of the Dog and set thier Info
   create an ArrayList named dogs and add those 10 dog objects
   write a program that can remove all the dogs that are not husky
